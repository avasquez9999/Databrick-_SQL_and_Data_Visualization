## Employee Attrition Analysis Using Databricks - SQL & Data Visualization
I used Databricks to perform exploratory analysis and data visualization to explore patterns and causes of attrition within a company, leveraging descriptive statistics and SQL queries. This approach helped to gain insights into the key factors influencing employee attrition, such as age, department, education, satisfaction, and business travel.

# Tools Used
Databricks SQL: For running SQL queries to aggregate and analyze employee attrition data.
Data Visualization: To visualize the findings, I used various charts like Bar Charts, Pie Charts, and Stacked Bar Charts in Databricks to better understand the data patterns.

# Key Insights from Visualizations
Age Group: Attrition rates were higher among younger employees (aged 20-32 years).
Department: Departments such as Sales and HR showed significantly higher attrition rates compared to others.
Education Level: Employees with lower educational attainment (below a college degree) had higher attrition rates.
Environment Satisfaction: Employees with lower environment satisfaction were more likely to leave the company.
Business Travel: Business travelers exhibited varied attrition patterns, with frequent travelers showing higher attrition rates.

# Conclusion
By utilizing SQL queries and visualizations in Databricks, I explored the employee attrition data from multiple dimensions, uncovering important patterns. These insights are valuable for understanding the underlying causes of attrition within the organization.

# Futher analyis

The findings can now be used for further predictive modeling or strategic interventions aimed at reducing attrition and comfirming assumtion found. I will extend this analysis into a more advanced predictive model for attrition forecasting or decision-making? using logistic regression, and desision tress and nural networks
